## Project Overview 📋
The **Railway Management System** is a web application designed to help users and administrators manage train bookings, view train details, and much more. The system supports two key roles:
- **Admin**: Can add, edit, and remove train details.
- **User**: Can search for trains between a source and destination and book tickets.

## Features 🌟
1. **User Authentication** 🔒:
   - Users can sign up and log in to the system.
   - Admin can sign up and log in using admin credentials.

2. **Train Search & Booking** 🔍:
   - Users can search for trains by entering source and destination.
   - If available, users can book train tickets.

3. **Ticket Generation** 🎫:
   - After booking, the system generates a ticket on a new page displaying the ticket details.

4. **Admin Dashboard** 🛠️:
   - Admin can add new trains, remove existing trains, and update train details.

5. **Database Integration** 🗃️:
   - The application is connected to a database (e.g., MySQL) for storing user information, train details, and ticket bookings.

## Installation & Setup 🛠️

To get started with the Railway Management System project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository** 📥
First, clone this project to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-management-system.git
```

### 2. **Navigate to Project Directory** 🗂️
Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd railway-management-system
```

### 3. **Frontend Setup (React)** 🚀
Navigate to the `client` directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
Start the React application:
