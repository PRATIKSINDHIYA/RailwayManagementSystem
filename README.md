# Railway Management System

## Project Overview
The Railway Management System is a web application designed to allow users and administrators to manage train bookings, train details, and more. The system supports two main roles:
- **Admin**: Can add, edit, and remove train details.
- **User**: Can search for trains between a source and destination and book tickets.

### Features:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - User can sign up and log in to the system.
   - Admin can sign up and log in with admin credentials.

2. **Train Search & Booking**:
   - Users can search for trains by entering the source and destination.
   - If available, the user can book a train ticket.

3. **Ticket Generation**:
   - After a successful booking, the system generates a ticket on a new page showing ticket details.

4. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Admin can add new trains, remove old trains, and update train details.

5. **Database Integration**:
   - The application is connected to a database (e.g., MySQL) to store user information, train details, and ticket bookings.
